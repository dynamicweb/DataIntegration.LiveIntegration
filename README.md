# Live Integration

A Live Integration is an extension of a batch integration which makes it possible to show e.g. live or customer-specific prices, live stock levels, or to have the remote system handle order, discount, and/or shipping fee calculations in real time.
Live Integration connects to the SOAP code unit installed in Business Central or Finance & Operations.
